./apvm --help
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run this before the CLI will work
eval "$(apvm env -s bash)"

# Install Atlaspack from atlassian-labs/atlaspack
# Versions obtained from git will build first
apvm install git:main       # main branch
apvm install git:my-branch  # branch name
apvm install git:d874396    # git hash

# Enable downloaded version
apvm use git:main

# Proxy commands to active atlaspack
apvm run -- --version 

# Proxy common commands on the top level to active atlaspack 
apvm build
apvm watch

# Use your local Atlaspack sources
export APVM_LOCAL="$HOME/development/atlasian-labs/atlaspack"
apvm use local

# Link Atlaspack into current project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
npm init -y
npm install @atlaspack/cli

apvm link git:main
apvm link local
```

## Notes

#### Building after fetching

Versions obtained from git will build after being fetched. This takes a while üôè

Distributing a prebuilt "super" package is being discussed which can resolve the install times

#### Eval must be run first

Eval must be run before running any commands or it won't work

#### Bash and Zsh supported

Fish and Windows users beware
