This is a placeholder file required because npm will only create 
a symlink to a `package.json#bin` entry if the file exists.

This file is replaced in a postinstall step with the actual binary 
fetched from GitHub releases.

This file has the .exe extension for Windows compatibility because 
Windows requires file extensions to make files executable. 

Linux and MacOS will be able to run the file as a normal binary 
regardless of the extension being present.
